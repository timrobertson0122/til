      collection_select(
      :post, # field namespace 
      :author_id, # field name
      # result of these two params will be: <select name="post[author_id]">...
  
      # then you should specify some collection or array of rows.
      # It can be Author.where(..).order(..) or something like that. 
      # In your example it is:
      Author.all, 
  
      # then you should specify methods for generating options
      :id, # this is name of method that will be called for every row, result will be set as key
      :name_with_initial, # this is name of method that will be called for every row, result will be set as value
  
      # as a result, every option will be generated by the following rule: 
      # <option value=#{author.id}>#{author.name_with_initial}</option>
      # 'author' is an element in the collection or array
  
      :prompt => true # then you can specify some params. You can find them in the docs.
