## Forking Workflow

Fork --> Clone --> Create Feature branch --> code, commit. Ready for a PR...

Rebase enables you to rewrite the order of history, by moving your commits forward to the point where origin/master is currently at.

git fetch (origin/master) --> git rebase origin/master --> git push -u origin/feature branch

Rebase -i starts an interactive rebasing session, allowing you to edit or merge commits, and is useful for tidying up your personal feature-branch commit messages into something cleaner and more useful to your colleagues.
Git provides clear instructions for adjusting your commit history in an interactive rebasing session.
