Accidentally logged output to a text file which got caught in a commit. Despite deleting the file locally every time I tried to push Github told me I couldn't because of this file. Found the following command on StackOverflow to fix it!

git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch <file/dir>' HEAD
