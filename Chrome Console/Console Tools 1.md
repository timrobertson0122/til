# DOM Manipulation

* When on the elements tab inside the console you can click and drag elements around the page, or even delete them. This can be useful when creating mockups where you want to show a simplified version.

* `contenteditable` - add this to the `<HTML>` or `<body>` tag on the page and you can then have a cursor on the page itself, allowing you to type whatever you want and update any text nodes accordingly.

* Scroll into view - Can't find that element on the page? Right click, then "Scroll into View" to bring it to you.

* $0 ($1..$4) - $0 is a magic variable in the console that points at the currently selected element in the inspector. $1-$4 are the next most recent. $($0) is a cryptic, but useful incantation that gives us the current node, wrapped as a jQuery object.

# CSS Manipulation

Within the CSS section of the console you can select an element and then use the up/down arrow keys to adjust an attribute (such as font size) and see a live representation in the browser.

Can use the pin to fix state (such as :active, :hover)

# Sources Tab

At the bottom of the document display there are a set of curly braces {}. Clicking these will beautify js/css that is generally minified, allowing you to read it again.
